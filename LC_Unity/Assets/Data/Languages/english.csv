haalmikahBarmaidLine1;Greetings my Lord. How can I help you?
haalmikahBarmaidLine2;The pleasure is mine.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier1;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier1Line1;Our walls are strong, but our weak point remains the skies.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier2;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier2Line1;The fortress is surrounded by forests and the Gornich Bay protects us north. They can only attack from the west and the skies.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3Line1;We must remain ready at all times. We are in charge of protecting the royal palace.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4Line1;We are preparing a new defensive strategy in case of an attack from Ulyomnis.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5Line1;There is no immediate threat, but we better be prepared!
haalmikahBarracksSoldierNearStairs;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldierNearStairsLine1;Sire, if you need to rest, beds are available downstairs.
haalmikahDiceAddict;Dice addict
haalmikahDiceAddictLine1;This place is so damn dead! Boring as hell! I'm not here to gossip, I wanna play dice!
haalmikahDrunkard;Drunkard
haalmikahDrunkardLine1;Hi, my Lord. Please enjoy a lil' glass with us! Tell us about dae gossip from the castle.
haalmikahDrunkardLine2;I'm sorry but I can't join right now. Captain Warlok is waiting for me.
haalmikahDrunkardLine3;Ain't no worries! Please, come back next time to enjoy a few pints with your fellas!

haalmikahHouseYoungGirlLine1;Mum spends all day either at the well, or with her face burried in a book. Is that how I will be as an adult too?
huntersClanHunter1;Hunter
huntersClanHunter1Line1;We complement the militia in protecting the fortress and its inhabitants. They are better at fighting armies, while we excel at vanquishing monsters.
huntersClanHunter1Line2;Our techniques are also more diverse and refined, as we have fought a plethora of different opponents.
huntersClanHunter2;Huntress
huntersClanHunter2Line1;Marks pay well, but always be on point! The targets Magnus finds quickly get hands on them.
huntersClanHunter2Line2;I guess it's difficult for a newcomer. The competition here is fierce.
huntersClanHunter3;Hunter
huntersClanHunter3Line1;Magnus, our leader, is downstairs. He manages the members, talks with the militia and finds us good preys to hunt.
huntersClanHunter3Line2;One of a kind, I'd say. He talks and hunts well. I just hunt, like an animal. I think we are all animals, after all.
huntersClanHunter4;Hunter
huntersClanHunter4Line1;Some hunters only stay in one area. They hunt what needs to be hunted. Whatever the target.
huntersClanHunter4Line2;Some hunters are travelers. They only hunt big marks, with a nice price on their head. I have to say, they are usually pretty good.
huntersClanSoldier;Soldier
huntersClanSoldierLine1;We owe a lot to these hunters. Without them, I don't think we could make it. And honestly, they are better than us.
huntersClanSoldierLine2;Although, I have to say, their manners sometimes don't match their technique...
haalmikahWellLady;Well Lady
haalmikahWellLadyLine1;The water from the well is so refreshing. But we have to moderate ourselves. Each person is allowed to draw water from the well only once a day.
haalmikahWellLadyLine2;Many preparations use water and it can also be used as a substitue to basic potions, although its effectiveness is inferior.
huntersClanVeteran;Veteran
huntersClanVeteranLine1;One should always use the most appropriate weapon type when fighting. But one should also consider elemental affinities.
huntersClanVeteranLine2;Most enemies have a weakness. Syblings usually share the same affinities.
haalmikahItemMerchant;Merchant
haalmikahItemMerchantLine1;Welcome! Please have a look!
haalmikahItemMerchantLine2;See you next time!
haalmikahItemShopCustomer;Customer
haalmikahItemShopCustomerLine1;Here you can only find pre-made products. But some merchants also offer crafting services!
haalmikahItemShopCustomerLine2;I have heard that some tools even allow to craft things in the wild!
haalmikahOldMan;Old Man
haalmikahOldManLine1;Oh, my lord! I heard you were practicing your combat skills with Captain Warlok.
haalmikahOldManLine2;Before venturing outside, please consider checking out the various shops in town.
haalmikahOldManLine3;You can also find food at the tavern to prepare your next battle.
haalmikahRegular1;Regular
haalmikahRegular1Line1;Since dice have no place here anymore, most of my friends go to the nearest village, Farment. But going through the Gramont Woods just for a dice roll? Hell nah!
haalmikahSoldierNearBarracks;Soldier
haalmikahSoldierNearBarracksLine1;My lord! May this beautiful day be filled with greatness and prowesses!
haalmikahSoldierNearBarracksLine2;The militia watches out for the Ulyomnian enemy! It never sleeps.
haalmikahTownsman1;Townsman
haalmikahTownsman1Line1;His Majesty has felt... easily upset since Lady Alynea passed away. You know it better, right?
haalmikahWeaponMerchant;Shopkeeper
haalmikahWeaponMerchantLine1;The finest weapons! Please have a look!
haalmikahWeaponMerchantLine2;Those blades will not disappoint.
