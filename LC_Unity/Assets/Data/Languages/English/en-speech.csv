haalmikahBarracksSoldier2;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier2Line1;The fortress is surrounded by forests and the Gornich Bay protects us north. They can only attack from the west and the skies.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3Line1;We must remain ready at all times. We are in charge of protecting the royal palace.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4Line1;We are preparing a new defensive strategy in case of an attack from Ulyomnis.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5Line1;There is no immediate threat, but we better be prepared!

haalmikahDrunkardLine1;Hi, my Lord. Please enjoy a lil' glass with us! Tell us about dae gossip from the castle.
haalmikahDrunkardLine2;I'm sorry but I can't join right now. Captain Warlok is waiting for me.
haalmikahDrunkardLine3;Ain't no worries! Please, come back next time to enjoy a few pints with your fellas!

huntersClanHunter1;Hunter
huntersClanHunter1Line1;We complement the militia in protecting the fortress and its inhabitants. They are better at fighting armies, while we excel at vanquishing monsters.
huntersClanHunter1Line2;Our techniques are also more diverse and refined, as we have fought a plethora of different opponents.
huntersClanHunter2;Huntress
huntersClanHunter2Line1;Marks pay well, but always be on point! The targets Magnus finds quickly get hands on them.
huntersClanHunter2Line2;I guess it's difficult for a newcomer. The competition here is fierce.
huntersClanHunter3;Hunter
huntersClanHunter3Line1;Magnus, our leader, is downstairs. He manages the members, talks with the militia and finds us good preys to hunt.
huntersClanHunter3Line2;One of a kind, I'd say. He talks and hunts well. I just hunt, like an animal. I think we are all animals, after all.
huntersClanHunter4;Hunter
huntersClanHunter4Line1;Some hunters only stay in one area. They hunt what needs to be hunted. Whatever the target.
huntersClanHunter4Line2;Some hunters are travelers. They only hunt big marks, with a nice price on their head. I have to say, they are usually pretty good.
huntersClanSoldier;Soldier
huntersClanSoldierLine1;We owe a lot to these hunters. Without them, I don't think we could make it. And honestly, they are better than us.
huntersClanSoldierLine2;Although, I have to say, their manners sometimes don't match their technique...
haalmikahWellLady;Well Lady
haalmikahWellLadyLine1;The water from the well is so refreshing. But we have to moderate ourselves. Each person is allowed to draw water from the well only once a day.
haalmikahWellLadyLine2;Many preparations use water and it can also be used as a substitue to basic potions, although its effectiveness is inferior.
huntersClanVeteran;Veteran
huntersClanVeteranLine1;One should always use the most appropriate weapon type when fighting. But one should also consider elemental affinities.
huntersClanVeteranLine2;Most enemies have a weakness. Syblings usually share the same affinities.

introText1;So you did dare to tread these Ulyomnian lands after all. Dagner, look! This is the cost of your thirst for conquest!
introText2;No Pernambulian business around! Opposition shall result in a bloodbath, close enough to what we witnessed today.
introText3;Now, withdraw what remains of your troops, or else the slaughter shall go on.
introText4;Let's get back to Pernambulis, my General.
introText5;There is no going back for your kind. Weaklings are not going back.
introText6;Weaklings do not know... They do not know the way of conquest. YOU do not know.
introText7;My General, I...
introText8;In the South, Pernambulis. In the North, Ulyomnis. At war for three decades.
introText9;A war to quench thirst of two men: Ulyomnian Emperor Terrakion IV, and Pernambulian King AÃ«rnold Gravis.
introText10;The thirst for power... The power of Novus crystals. And the large and unstable power they provide.
introText11;Pernambulis claims ownership of the flying crystal structure, given it is mostly located on its territory. But Ulyomnis disagrees.
introText12;A war that revolves around supreme power. Such great power... Meaningless compared to what may exist.
introText13;This would be Dagner's last battle leading the army of Pernambulis.
introText14;Godfried Henri Markus Dagner, General of the Army of Pernambulis. The present trial shall decide your punishment for your barbarian acts and behaviour.
introText15;You are more a butcher than a war leader, seeking nothing but to quench thirst for conquest. Slaying both enemies and allies alike.
introText16;What use of an army who cannot fight? What use of a bunch of weaklings on a battlefield? Better just get rid of them.
introText17;Too much blood was shed in the name of your judgement for... weaklings. That blood will serve you no longer.
introText18;It is time you question your deeds, your acts, your intentions. On your own. The Army of Pernambulis you shall no longer command. This cannot be contested.
introText19;The Great Book of Laws is clear on that matter: you shall bear the same punishment you inflicted to those poor souls on the battlefield, soon enough.
introText20;It was clear: Dagner would be executed. Motive: crime against Pernambulis. The man would be considered a threat to the kingdom. A few hours in a cell first...
introText21;A few hours to... think. Never did I agree with those barbarian punishments. My father never considered abolishing those, despite us arguing when dicussing their use...
introText22;Maybe I will not meet glory in the end... Maybe I will die as a weakling.
introText23;And now we even have illusions in my own damn cell... What a day!
introText24;As if glory... was an illusion!
introText25;I can free you from the fate drawn upon you. Trust me, follow me and glory shall be yours. You are hungry, thristy... I can feel it. Come, the way is ahead.
introText26;The General's deceased body was carried by the shore of Gornich Bay, up North. The depths of the Bay would act as a proper graveyard for traitors and criminals...
introText27;Dagner was not executed in blood. No... They opted for a slow agony, a man paralyzed with every bit inside slowly getting torn apart by torture spells. Much less bloody than what the General was used to.
introText28;Some may have even said he was just sleeping... Sleeping in the depths. The cold, cold depths.
introText29;My Lord, I am finally here. I know you were expecting me.
introText30;Gamera... You know about my patience, don't you?
introText31;My Lord...
introText32;You know why I asked you to come here, don't you?
introText33;Yes, my Lord... But, wouldn't there be another way...?
introText34;What is your point Gamera? Feable creatures from your world have no meaningful lives to care for.
introText35;I beg your pardon?
introText36;I... accomplished so much for you, my Lord. All my duties, even the most disgusting ones... Without even a bit of recognition from you?!
introText37;What did you expect from me? Compassion? Praise? You are such a foolish creature.
introText38;And now you are doubting. Doubting me and yourself. What were you of use all this time anyway, right? Did you even think of it?
introText39;Lord Dagner, I...
introText40;Silence!
introText41;Doubting life and death is like doubting my power. None shall doubt it! Because it exists, and it is large and great!
introText42;Now, begone! Weakling!
introText43;I will have to finish the job myself. The conquest goes on, Gravis. You better be prepared.
introText44;Gamera was once among my father's men. Although some... controversial events led him to leave and explore other realms.
introText45;Maybe life at the castle was a better plan in the end? Because life could have actually gone on by our side.
introText46;I was about to do the same mistake. A mistake which would not be the first... nor the last. I was foolish and young. But it still led me to where I am today.
introText47;Dagner... You have come back.
introText48;Joachim, I would like a word.
introText49;Be my guest.
introText50;The troops are doubting our power. I am worried they might commit mistakes.
introText51;Are you doubting, you too?
introText52;They believe they are more than just pawns, that they have a right to make history. So I had to deal with some of them.
introText53;You do not have to bother with their thoughts. They do not know anything. They do not matter. And you should not care about them. At all.
introText54;Oh, and about Gravis... Just take care of the old man. The rest is my business. And you shall not mind it.
introText55;Can you take on this alone? That's quite a task...
introText56;Only weaklings seek for help. Am I mistaken?
introText57;I recently had a talk with my father about the recent events, the execution and whatnot. Coming to our usual disagreement, I decided to take a breath and went outside to change my mind.
introText58;My father was convinced there was no other way to treat criminals. Perhaps something could be done so those people could reflect on their acts?
introText59;Maybe my thoughts and acts were immature. Maybe things would have been different if they were not...?
introText60;Sire, I have heard that His Majesty is rather... tense when His ideas are getting questioned, as you mentionned.
introText61;I have no idea Cap'n. Only Mother could calm him down, and reason him.
introText62;I needed some fresh air. Since General Dagner's execution, Father and I haven't had a word.
introText63;His Majesty may be tormented as he should have never given power to this man. That also means He needs to reflect on Himself, which is difficult, apparently.
introText64;Tell me... Would you be up for a quick session outside? You mentionned you wanted to learn to wield a blade.
introText65;I could show you some moves which may prove useful, would you travel to unsafe lands.
introText66;Your memory serves you well, Cap'n. Lead the way!
introText67;Then let's get going. There's vermin to take down!
quest0Dialog0;Ah there you are! Follow me to the grove. Just head west, then south. I'll be waiting there.
quest0Dialog1;I can see your sense of orientation is decent. But how about your combat skill?
quest0Dialog2;Take this sword. You'll need it soon enough.
quest0Dialog3;Now you need to equip it. Open the Main menu and access your Equipment tab.
quest0DialogNoWeaponEquipped;You need to equip your new weapon through the Equipment tab of the main menu before we can proceed.
quest0DialogNoWeaponInInventory;What do you mean you LOST your weapon?! Ok take this one then...
quest0Dialog4;There's a rat near the waters. Show me what you can do.
quest0Dialog5;Great, newbie. Now I want you to treat that scarymbe over there the same way.
quest0Dialog6;That looked like a breeze from here. Congratulations!
quest0Dialog7;We'll do a quick review once we are back in town. Follow me.
quest1Dialog0;Actually, I did not expect the scarymbe to cast a spell. I was not ready to parry.
quest1Dialog1;Haha, maybe I wanted to you to realise there is more to combat than just...
quest1Dialog2;Cap'n, Cap'n! The castle... it's under assault. From nowhere.
quest1Dialog3;But what do those pesky Ulyos want again?!
quest1Dialog4;Immediately! Get some troops to defend the bastion. The rest heads to the castle at once!
quest1Dialog5;Sire, stay safe. The militia will guard you no matter what!
quest1Dialog6;But Cap'n... I wish to...
quest1Dialog7;We ain't talking about rats, we're talking the actual enemy! The kind you are not ready for yet, I'm sorry.
quest1Dialog8;Soldiers, watch over the Prince! I'm taking the rest of the pack to the castle.
quest1Dialog9;Understood, Cap'n!
quest1Dialog10;What madness is this?!
quest1Dialog11;Soldiers! For the King!
quest1Dialog12;For King Gravis!
quest1Dialog13;Common folks are not allowed to leave buildings before the situation returns to normal. These are the orders of the Captain.
quest1Dialog14;The bastion isn't under assault. Only the castle. There is no soul wandering outside right now.
quest1Dialog15;And as the castle is the only target, we can only presume the attack has nothing to do with Ulyomnis.
quest1Dialog16;How did you come up with that, Magnus?! You haven't put your nose outside since the assault began!!
quest1Dialog17;A Jagermeister listens, watches, waits. Precisely acting at the very best moment.
quest1Dialog18;Once chaos has been reduced, we can intervene. And that's precisely when we need you, Sire!
quest1Dialog19;Uh...?
quest1Dialog20;Cap'n Warlok put the prince under our protection!
quest1Dialog21;And the remparts of the bastion are a great shield for His Majesty. I didn't mean to let Him go outside the walls.
quest1Dialog22;He should see by Himself what mayhem such attack can cause. The day He takes the lead, He should be ready!
quest1Dialog23;At least, allow the prince to go outside the barracks. His people needs Him. He has to reassure them!
quest1Dialog24;Very well... But then, you will take care. The safety of his Majesty will also depend on you, Magnus.
quest1Dialog25;Do not worry about Warlok by the way. Him, a fine bottle and myself will have a good talk about all this later.
quest1Dialog26;Sire, please follow me outside.
quest1Dialog27;Ah sire, free like a bird!
quest1Dialog28;Please, don't put yourself in such hassle because of me... although, thank you.
quest1Dialog29;A Jagermeister waits and acts when time fits best. The field is ready, words are sharp and loaded. Quickly, everyone agrees!
quest1Dialog30;But hey, jokes and plays aside, take this.
quest1Dialog31;What is...? Don't tell me you are considering it?! How do you plan on telling the guards and the Captain?!
quest1Dialog32;The guards need the hunters clan. We have an agreement. However, sometimes negociation is required...
quest1Dialog33;And as you got the hint, I like to convince other parties. You, at first. Followed by the guards and the Captain.
quest1Dialog34;We have to break a way through. The exit is well guarded, but I hold the magic key.
quest1Dialog35;A magic key...? Me?
quest1Dialog36;Don't speak nonsense! If anything, you're probably the most unreliable lockpick in my bag!
quest1Dialog37;However... Follow me.
quest1Dialog38;O mighty guards!
quest1Dialog39;What does the hunta' want this time...?
quest1Dialog40;Shut up! We have to stay on good terms with the clan. Or else, we're good to take care of the low-class jobs outside the town.
quest1Dialog41;The situation requires critical actions. The pernambulian people needs the help of the hunters. Hence why I decided to bring in the freshest meat.
quest1Dialog42;And what kind of...meat? I don't see anyone who could...
quest1Dialog43;You moron, did you just turn even more crazy?! Never shall the prince take the bite at the castle!
quest1Dialog44;And what if He chose to become a hunter? From that moment, He follows me.
quest1Dialog45;I take care of Captain Warlok. We're good friends. The prince is in good hands, as long as instructions are perfectly followed.
quest1Dialog46;Hmpf!
quest1Dialog47;Fine! But get out of here! Quick!
quest1Dialog48;Also... One less hair on that boy's head, and you can wipe yourself with all these agreements between us and the clan... Got it?
quest1Dialog49;Young hair grows back. I wouldn't worry too much about that.
quest1Dialog50;To hell you go!!! Leave at once!
quest1Dialog51;All this play... it feels a bit much, sire Magnus.
quest1Dialog52;Rookie, starting now there needs no manner. Use your attention to stay alive. I'm counting on you.
quest1Dialog53;We aim for the castle. Get there quickly and don't get distracted by things along the way.
quest1Dialog54;Damn it! The hell you doing here!?
quest1Dialog55;You're spitting on our agreements, Magnus!?
quest1Dialog56;I just brought in the new recruit. And he's having a pretty good opener!
quest1Dialog57;Uh... Captain...
quest1Dialog58;Hmpf! Anyway, we'll deal with this later. We need arms and blades, and you just happen to show up.
quest1Dialog59;Castle is filled with fiends from the unknown! My troops are already in charge of the main hall.
quest1Dialog60;Still, the rest of the building remains unclean. Come along, so I can keep an eye on you...
quest1Dialog61;Soldiers! Get back to your mates! They need you!
quest1Dialog62;Roger, Cap'n!
quest1Dialog63;My apologies...
quest1Dialog64;No remorse nor regret on the battlefield, soldier! Keep this for later!
quest1CannotAccessMainHall;There are still fiends around in the upper floors of the castle. We need to take care of those first!
quest1Dialog65;That should do...
quest1Dialog66;Newbie, I have to say I am impressed. You didn't shine, you but did't impair us, which is quite good already.
quest1Dialog67;So Captain, our agreement still stands ?
quest1Dialog68;You ain't getting away with this that easily, Mista' Hunta'!
quest1Dialog69;Perhaps we should head to the throne room now. I hope Father is okay.
quest1Dialog70;The King!
