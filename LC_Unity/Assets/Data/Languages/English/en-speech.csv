haalmikahBarracksSoldier2;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier2Line1;The fortress is surrounded by forests and the Gornich Bay protects us north. They can only attack from the west and the skies.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier3Line1;We must remain ready at all times. We are in charge of protecting the royal palace.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier4Line1;We are preparing a new defensive strategy in case of an attack from Ulyomnis.
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5;Soldier
haalmikahBarracksSoldier5Line1;There is no immediate threat, but we better be prepared!

haalmikahBarracksSoldierNearStairsLine1;Sire, if you need to rest, beds are available downstairs.

haalmikahDrunkardLine1;Hi, my Lord. Please enjoy a lil' glass with us! Tell us about dae gossip from the castle.
haalmikahDrunkardLine2;I'm sorry but I can't join right now. Captain Warlok is waiting for me.
haalmikahDrunkardLine3;Ain't no worries! Please, come back next time to enjoy a few pints with your fellas!

huntersClanHunter1;Hunter
huntersClanHunter1Line1;We complement the militia in protecting the fortress and its inhabitants. They are better at fighting armies, while we excel at vanquishing monsters.
huntersClanHunter1Line2;Our techniques are also more diverse and refined, as we have fought a plethora of different opponents.
huntersClanHunter2;Huntress
huntersClanHunter2Line1;Marks pay well, but always be on point! The targets Magnus finds quickly get hands on them.
huntersClanHunter2Line2;I guess it's difficult for a newcomer. The competition here is fierce.
huntersClanHunter3;Hunter
huntersClanHunter3Line1;Magnus, our leader, is downstairs. He manages the members, talks with the militia and finds us good preys to hunt.
huntersClanHunter3Line2;One of a kind, I'd say. He talks and hunts well. I just hunt, like an animal. I think we are all animals, after all.
huntersClanHunter4;Hunter
huntersClanHunter4Line1;Some hunters only stay in one area. They hunt what needs to be hunted. Whatever the target.
huntersClanHunter4Line2;Some hunters are travelers. They only hunt big marks, with a nice price on their head. I have to say, they are usually pretty good.
huntersClanSoldier;Soldier
huntersClanSoldierLine1;We owe a lot to these hunters. Without them, I don't think we could make it. And honestly, they are better than us.
huntersClanSoldierLine2;Although, I have to say, their manners sometimes don't match their technique...
haalmikahWellLady;Well Lady
haalmikahWellLadyLine1;The water from the well is so refreshing. But we have to moderate ourselves. Each person is allowed to draw water from the well only once a day.
haalmikahWellLadyLine2;Many preparations use water and it can also be used as a substitue to basic potions, although its effectiveness is inferior.
huntersClanVeteran;Veteran
huntersClanVeteranLine1;One should always use the most appropriate weapon type when fighting. But one should also consider elemental affinities.
huntersClanVeteranLine2;Most enemies have a weakness. Syblings usually share the same affinities.

haalmikahOldManLine1;Oh, my lord! I heard you were practicing your combat skills with Captain Warlok.
haalmikahOldManLine2;Before venturing outside, please consider checking out the various shops in town.
haalmikahOldManLine3;You can also find food at the tavern to prepare your next battle.

haalmikahRegular1Line1;Since dice have no place here anymore, most of my friends go to the nearest village, Farment. But going through the Gramont Woods just for a dice roll? Hell nah!

introText1;So you did dare to tread these Ulyomnian lands after all. Dagner, look! This is the cost of your thirst for conquest!
introText2;No Pernambulian business around! Opposition shall result in a bloodbath, close enough to what we witnessed today.
introText3;Now, withdraw what remains of your troops, or else the slaughter shall go on.
introText4;Let's get back to Pernambulis, my General.
introText5;There is no going back for your kind. Weaklings are not going back.
introText6;Weaklings do not know... They do not know the way of conquest. YOU do not know.
introText7;My General, I...
introText8;In the South, Pernambulis. In the North, Ulyomnis. At war for three decades.
introText9;A war to quench thirst of two men: Ulyomnian Emperor Terrakion IV, and Pernambulian King AÃ«rnold Gravis.
introText10;The thirst for power... The power of Novus crystals. And the large and unstable power they provide.
introText11;Pernambulis claims ownership of the flying crystal structure, given it is mostly located on its territory. But Ulyomnis disagrees.
introText12;A war that revolves around supreme power. Such great power... Meaningless compared to what may exist.
introText13;This would be Dagner's last battle leading the army of Pernambulis.
introText14;Godfried Henri Markus Dagner, General of the Army of Pernambulis. The present trial shall decide your punishment for your barbarian acts and behaviour.
introText15;You are more a butcher than a war leader, seeking nothing but to quench thirst for conquest. Slaying both enemies and allies alike.
introText16;What use of an army who cannot fight? What use of a bunch of weaklings on a battlefield? Better just get rid of them.
introText17;Too much blood was shed in the name of your judgement for... weaklings. That blood will serve you no longer.
introText18;It is time you question your deeds, your acts, your intentions. On your own. The Army of Pernambulis you shall no longer command. This cannot be contested.
introText19;The Great Book of Laws is clear on that matter: you shall bear the same punishment you inflicted to those poor souls on the battlefield, soon enough.
introText20;It was clear: Dagner would be executed. Motive: crime against Pernambulis. The man would be considered a threat to the kingdom. A few hours in a cell first...
introText21;A few hours to... think. Never did I agree with those barbarian punishments. My father never considered abolishing those, despite us arguing when dicussing their use...
introText22;Maybe I will not meet glory in the end... Maybe I will die as a weakling.
introText23;And now we even have illusions in my own damn cell... What a day!
introText24;As if glory... was an illusion!
introText25;I can free you from the fate drawn upon you. Trust me, follow me and glory shall be yours. You are hungry, thristy... I can feel it. Come, the way is ahead.
introText26;The General's deceased body was carried by the shore of Gornich Bay, up North. The depths of the Bay would act as a proper graveyard for traitors and criminals...
introText27;Dagner was not executed in blood. No... They opted for a slow agony, a man paralyzed with every bit inside slowly getting torn apart by torture spells. Much less bloody than what the General was used to.
introText28;Some may have even said he was just sleeping... Sleeping in the depths. The cold, cold depths.
introText29;My Lord, I am finally here. I know you were expecting me.
introText30;Gamera... You know about my patience, don't you?
introText31;My Lord...
introText32;You know why I asked you to come here, don't you?
introText33;Yes, my Lord... But, wouldn't there be another way...?
introText34;What is your point Gamera? Feable creatures from your world have no meaningful lives to care for.
introText35;I beg your pardon?
introText36;I... accomplished so much for you, my Lord. All my duties, even the most disgusting ones... Without even a bit of recognition from you?!
introText37;What did you expect from me? Compassion? Praise? You are such a foolish creature.
introText38;And now you are doubting. Doubting me and yourself. What were you of use all this time anyway, right? Did you even think of it?
introText39;Lord Dagner, I...
introText40;Silence!
introText41;Doubting life and death is like doubting my power. None shall doubt it! Because it exists, and it is large and great!
introText42;Now, begone! Weakling!
introText43;I will have to finish the job myself. The conquest goes on, Gravis. You better be prepared.
introText44;Gamera was once among my father's men. Although some... controversial events led him to leave and explore other realms.
introText45;Maybe life at the castle was a better plan in the end? Because life could have actually gone on by our side.
introText46;I was about to do the same mistake. A mistake which would not be the first... nor the last. I was foolish and young. But it still led me to where I am today.
introText47;Dagner... You have come back.
introText48;Joachim, I would like a word.
introText49;Be my guest.
introText50;The troops are doubting our power. I am worried they might commit mistakes.
introText51;Are you doubting, you too?
introText52;They believe they are more than just pawns, that they have a right to make history. So I had to deal with some of them.
introText53;You do not have to bother with their thoughts. They do not know anything. They do not matter. And you should not care about them. At all.
introText54;Oh, and about Gravis... Just take care of the old man. The rest is my business. And you shall not mind it.
introText55;Can you take on this alone? That's quite a task...
introText56;Only weaklings seek for help. Am I mistaken?
introText57;I recently had a talk with my father about the recent events, the execution and whatnot. Coming to our usual disagreement, I decided to take a breath and went outside to change my mind.
introText58;My father was convinced there was no other way to treat criminals. Perhaps something could be done so those people could reflect on their acts?
introText59;Maybe my thoughts and acts were immature. Maybe things would have been different if they were not...?
introText60;J'entends beaucoup dire, sir, que sa MajestÃ© votre PÃ¨re est trÃ¨s... remuÃ© lorsqu'on remet ses idÃ©es en question, comme vous dites.
introText61;Vous n'avez pas idÃ©e, capitaine. Vous n'avez pas idÃ©e... Il n'y avait que MÃ¨re qui avait le don pour le calmer... et le raisonner, accessoirement.
introText62;J'avais besoin d'air. Depuis l'exÃ©cution du gÃ©nÃ©ral Dagner, nous ne nous adressons plus un mot.
introText63;Je pense que sa MajestÃ© est tourmentÃ© car il n'aurait jamais dÃ» donner du pouvoir Ã  cet homme. Et selon vos dires, il n'aime pas se remettre en question.
introText64;Dites-moi... Seriez-vous partant pour une petite session en extÃ©rieur ? Vous m'aviez parler d'une envie d'apprendre Ã  manier le fer.
introText65;Je pourrais vous montrer quelques gestes qui pourraient vous servir, l'envie vous prendrait de vous promener en terre moins paisible qu'ici.
introText66;Je vous remercie de votre bonne mÃ©moire, capitaine. Je vous suis.
introText67;Alors partons. Nous avons du pain sur la planche. Et de la vermine Ã  chasser.
introText68;Je vous laisse vous prÃ©parer, sir. Retrouvez-moi Ã  l'entrÃ©e de la forteresse dÃ¨s que vous serez prÃªt.
introText69;Oh et ne vous tracassez pas pour votre Ã©quipement. J'emmÃ¨ne ce qu'il faut sur le terrain.
quest0Dialog0;Ah there you are! Follow me to the grove. Just head west, then south. I'll be waiting there.
quest0Dialog1;I can see your sense of orientation is decent. But how about your combat skill?
quest0Dialog2;Take this sword. You'll need it soon enough.
quest0Dialog3;Now you need to equip it. Open the Main menu and access your Equipment tab.
quest0DialogNoWeaponEquipped;You need to equip your new weapon through the Equipment tab of the main menu before we can proceed.
quest0DialogNoWeaponInInventory;What do you mean you LOST your weapon?! Ok take this one then...
quest0Dialog4;Let's take care of that rat over there.
